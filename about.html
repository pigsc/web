				My name's Jared 'PiG' Krensel, I'm a Professional Starcraft II player, commentator, coach and streamer from Sydney, Australia.

				In recent months I've decided to stream on Twitch Full-time and am having a lot of fun improving the quality of the stream and finding new ways to have fun and entertain my audience. Sometimes I travel to commentate or compete in Starcraft Tournaments but I always try to stream as soon as I get home.
